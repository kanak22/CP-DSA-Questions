'''
For each subtree, we return 4 elements.

the status of this subtree, 1 means it's empty, 2 means it's a BST, 0 means it's not a BST
size of this subtree (we only care about size of BST though)
the minimal value in this subtree
the maximal value in this subtree
Then we only need to make sure for every BST

both of its children are BST
the right bound of its left child is smaller than root.val
the left bound of its right child is larger than root.val
